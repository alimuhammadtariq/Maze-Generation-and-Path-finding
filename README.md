# Maze-Generation-and-Path-finding
As part of my recent exploration of graph theory and algorithm design, I developed a Python-based program to dynamically generate and solve complex mazes.

üîç Maze Generation: Implemented a maze generation algorithm using randomized depth-first search (DFS), creating intricate mazes that are visualized in real-time using Pygame.

üõ§Ô∏è Pathfinding: Solved the generated mazes using Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm, demonstrating proficiency in advanced graph data structures and algorithms. This project involved optimizing the pathfinding process by:

Efficiently building and navigating graph representations of mazes.

Diagnosing and resolving algorithmic challenges such as infinite loops.

Enhancing the robustness of the solution by refining end conditions and node processing.

This project not only expanded my knowledge of Python and Pygame but also reinforced key concepts in AI-driven problem-solving and optimization.
